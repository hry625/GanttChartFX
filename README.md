## How to modify the Gantt chart to fit your need:
1. You may want to change the projectActivity to fit your project.
2. Using convertActivityToGanttChartActivity() function to convert your own activity class to fit GanttChartActivity. 
3. Modify the default.css file to style the Gantt chart as you prefer.
